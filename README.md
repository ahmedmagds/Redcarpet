Genomic recombination is a generator of biological diversity and plays an important role in microbial adaptation to new environments, hosts, and niches. Recombination detection previously relied on genomic sequence alignment and phylogenetic or comparative techniques that are computationally expensive, especially with vast increases in available whole genome sequences.

Here we present a database-driven technique that is alignment-free, does not rely on phylogeny or sequence similarity, and can be used rapidly on single genomes on a standard desktop. The tool, Redcarpet, combines the analytic output from our recently developed WhatsGNU algorithm1 with a MinHash technique2. This operation is predicated on the idea that identical genes are more likely to appear in the same set of genomes if they share a common evolutionary history
